# Starcraft 2 Agent using python-sc2 and PySC2

Currently a basic scripted agent that amasses an army of Zealots, Archons and Immortals, upgrades ground weapons and armor and attacks the opponent when army supply is enough.

 _Road Plan for the agent (In the hopes that it would be able to play league matches in SC2AI bot league):_

- Optimize, optimize, optimize
- Add smarter strategy making based current state of the game (Invest in economy or army, scouting info etc)
- Add tactical decision making (micro) in battles (Retreat, stutter-step, spells, positioning etc)
